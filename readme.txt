== Description ==

Crawls your website-pages based on any XML sitemap. If you have a caching plugin this will keep your cache warm. 
Speeds up your site.<br>
Compatible with following elements: < sitemap > < url ><br>
All urls in your sitemap will be visited by the plugin to keep the cache up to date.<br>
Will show average page load times and pages visited.<br>

Needs google XML sitemap to read the generated XML file.<br>
Needs a cronjob (wget or curl) to call the plugin. You need to setup the cronjob yourself! (Or ask your sysadmin to help you).<br>

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How to run a cronjob? =
> Ask your webhost how to set up a get call using wget or curl

= I have set up the cronjob but the stats table on the plugin page remains empty. =
> If you have object caching such as W3 total cache, the statistics cannot be read.<br>
A help topic about this is placed <a href="http://wordpress.org/support/topic/plugin-w3-total-cache-strange-transient-problem?replies=1">on the support forums</a>.
Note that the script is crawling your XML file (check your webhosts access log), but you cannot see the statistics.
